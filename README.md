# Tableau-Full-Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases my data exploration and visualization skills using Tableau. I worked with raw data, performed cleaning, and conducted in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights. The final deliverable is an interactive Tableau dashboard that communicates findings effectively.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and prepare raw data for visualization.
- Conduct EDA to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
-  Create visually appealing and interactive dashboards in Tableau.
-   Provide actionable insights for decision-making.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Tableau – for data visualization and EDA.
- Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets – for initial data review.
-  Data Cleaning Techniques – removal of duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process
- Imported the dataset into Tableau.
- Checked for null values and addressed missing data.
- Standardized data formats (dates, categories, text).
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.
- Renamed and organized fields for clarity.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Tableau
The following key analyses were performed:
- Trend Analysis: Identified changes over time.
- Category Comparisons: Compared metrics across different categories.
- Correlation Insights: Detected relationships between variables.
- Outlier Detection: Highlighted unusual values for further review.

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- Interactive Filters: Users can drill down by category, date, or region.
- Dynamic Charts: Automatically update based on filter selections.
- KPI Indicators: Display key performance metrics.
- Visual Storytelling: Clear layout guiding viewers through insights step-by-step.

## 📢 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the value of combining data cleaning, EDA, and visualization in Tableau to produce clear, actionable insights. The dashboard can help stakeholders quickly identify trends and make informed decisions.
